# BambooBets Frontend (Public Version)

## Introduction
This repository contains all of the code for the frontend of BambooBets. This is a Web3 application and the smart contracts were deployed to the Polygon testnet.

## Preface
There are two things to keep in mind when looking through this codebase.

- A variety of changes need to be made before this is in a fully workable state.
- This code is no longer maintained and maintenance stopped in December of 2023.
- All "back-end" functionality for this app is handled by a variety of smart contracts. All of these contracts were deployed to the Polygon testnet, so, to use this app, you simply need to connect a wallet and get some MATIC (the original contracts are no longer active).
- This app doesn't support betting with anything other than test tokens.
- All "randomness" is handled by Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function.
- The .env.example file is meant to serve as a reference for the environment variable configuration. It is **NOT** a secure and optimal storage solution for environment variables.
- This application is no longer serviced by any of the third-party applications mentioned throughout the app.
